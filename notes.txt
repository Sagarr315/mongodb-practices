1. What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database â€” unlike traditional databases (like MySQL or SQL Server) that use tables,
MongoDB stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called documents.
Itâ€™s perfect for applications where data structure can change often (like modern web apps).


âœ¨ Main Features (Short & Sweet):
1.Document-Oriented: Data is stored in documents (like JSON objects).
2.Schema-less: You donâ€™t need to define the structure of data (no fixed columns).
3.High Performance: Super fast for read/write operations.
4.Scalable: Handles big data easily with horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
5.Flexible: You can store arrays, nested objects, etc.



ðŸ“„ Core Concepts
1. Database
Like a folder. Contains collections.

2. Collection
Like a table in SQL, but without fixed schema. Contains documents.

Example:
users collection, products collection

3. Document
Like a row in SQL, but in JSON format.

Example:{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 25,
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

Each document can have different fields. One document can have "age", another might not.



4. _id
Every document automatically gets a unique _id field (like a primary key).

Differences Between SQL VS MongoDB Terminology:

SQL	          MongoDB

Table	         Collection
Row	         Document
Column	         Field
Primary Key	 _id
JOIN	         Embedding/Nesting (or $lookup for joins)
